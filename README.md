## Week 1

### Lesson 1 & 2

If we can observe something from this lesson we can observe that you must Be Patient & Calm. This is a note for me in the future. You must summarize all lessons, do assignments and don't skip challenges.

### Lesson 3 & 4

### Lesson 5

- The file that the code is written in it is called the source file
- The code that is written in this file is called Source Code

### Lesson 6

The C++ compilation process is the process of converting C++ source code into an executable program. It involves several steps, including **preprocessing**, **compiling**, and **linking**.

During preprocessing, the preprocessor reads the source code and processes any preprocessor directives, such as `#include` and `#define`. These directives tell the preprocessor to include other files or replace certain text in the source code.

Next, the compiler takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into object code, which is a low-level representation of the program that can be executed by the computer.

Finally, during linking, the linker takes the object code and combines it with any necessary libraries to create an executable program.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions. ðŸ˜Š
