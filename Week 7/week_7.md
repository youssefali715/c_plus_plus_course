# Loops (For, While, Do...While)
The Loop is made according to concept called [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) which means **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself

## For Loop
- It is used to make specific number of loops
- Syntax:
  ```
  for (initilaize, condition, update)
  {
    // Our Block Of code
  }
  ```
- (initilaize, condition, update) are all optional conditions, If you want to don't use them, You must keep their semi-colons.

## While Loop
- It is used to loop as long as condition is true
- Syntax:
  ```
  while(condition)
  {
    // Block Of code
  }
  ```

## Do...While Loop
- It excutes the code before checking
- Syntax:
  ```
  do
  {
    // Block Of Code
  } while (condition)
  ```

## KeyWords
- `break;` is used to stop the loop in a specific iteration
- `continue;` is used to skip the current iteration
